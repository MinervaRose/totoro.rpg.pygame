# t.rpg.pygame :seedling: :shell:

This basic RPG was created after completing the [Learn python Programming course by Zenva Academy](https://academy.zenva.com/certificate/53d92223/).

## Project overview 

This first version of the project allowed me to work with the following concepts in Python:

* [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about)
* Setting up the display
* Building a basic game loop
* Displaying shapes and images
* Classes
* Basic movement
* Bounds checking
* Collision detection
* Win and lose conditions
* Increasing game difficulty

Check out [this great tutorial](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/) about PyGame logic, collision detection, and drawing. 

## Description :herb:

A basic RPG, one background, get the treasure chest.
* Player Sprite can move up, down, left, right
* Use arrow keys or WASD controls
* Number and speed of ennemies increase after each win

## Design and illustration :umbrella:

* The pixel sprites were designed with the help of [this tutorial](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/render-a-simple-3d-pixel-space-invaders-in-adobe-illustrator--cms-21185). For pixel-perfect artwork using Adobe Illustrator, check out [this tutorial](https://design.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-create-pixel-perfect-artwork-using-adobe-illustrator--cms-23907).

## Further developments

Further development will include:
* Life and scores
* More backgrounds
* Sliding
* More actions such as pushing objects
* Increasing the variety of villains
* Giving the user choice of gameplay music

:octocat: *Kind notice: as stated above this is a personal student project created by me, Sabrina Palis. I am neither providing the code, graphic assets, or distributing this project. Video with imovie, pixel artwork and fan art by me. This repo entry was done with the hope of providing inspiration to other coding students and future students*
